\subsection{\textsc{QSERV-VER-00-05}: Qserv code inspection}
\label{qserv-ver-00-05}

\subsubsection{Requirements}

\subsubsection{Test items}

This test will check:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{That the code delivered complies with relevant DM software quality standards;}
  \item{That the code is accompanied by appropriate documentation;}
  \item{That the code makes use of appropriate DM interfaces to the rest of the system where applicable;}
  \item{That the code is appropriately tested.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Intercase dependencies}

None.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Check for the existence of a suite of unit test cases accompanying the codebase;}

  \item{Check the code to demonstrate that uses only standardized DM interfaces for such things as logging
  and configuration (i.e. it does not print directly to screen nor does it contain ad-hoc configuration
  parsers);}

  \item{Check that the code is accompanied by a user manual describing procedures for its installation and
  operation.}

\end{itemize}
